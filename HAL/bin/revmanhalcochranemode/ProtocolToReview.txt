----Abstract----
----Background----
PP All full reviews must include an abstract of 400 words or fewer. The abstract should brief without sacrificing important content. Abstracts to Cochrane reviews are published in MEDLINE and the Science Citation Index, and are made freely available on the internet. It is therefore important that they can be read as stand-alone documents.

II Guidance for the content of an abstract is provided in Chapter 11 (Section 11.8).
BP Example text for sections are given below -please make sure these examples are relevant for your title and review -adapt if necessary.
----Objectives----
BP This text must match your objectives in the protocol.
----Search methods----
PP We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register 
BP (give date of your search -it must be the same as the date in the main search text)
SP , inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies and contacted authors of relevant studies.
----Selection criteria----
PP We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing ..................

----Data collection and analysis----
PP We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If heterogeneity was identified, this was explored using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE.
----Main results----
BP This section should give a summary of the number of trials included with number of participants randomised and present the main results -it should link in with the SOF findings, giving the grade of evidence. If outcomes of interested listed in the protocol were not reported in the studies this should be noted, particularly adverse effects. Brief description of any bias within included trials should be noted.
SB all numerical results should be presented as 
SP ( x RCT, n = x, RR or MD xx CI xx to xx, xxxx quality evidence)
----Authors' conclusions----
BP Authors conclusions should be based on the results presented only. Reference to the quality of evidence results based on should also be noted.
----Plain language summary----
DT This is an example of a plain language summary from a published review -it requires a brief explanation of condition, intervention, date of search, number of trials, types of participants and interventions, main results, quality of evidence, missing outcomes and conclusion based on results....with minimum use of complex terms -if these are necessary they should be explained. If people are available editorial base may be able to find a consumer volunteer to write the PLS -if authors are interested please contact editorial base.
DT Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects a persons thoughts, perceptions and emotions. Research has found that the chance of someone with mental illness having a relapse is greater when their family is over-involved, hostile, critical and dissatisfied -a concept known as 'expressed emotions'. Family interventions have been shown to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia and are now widely used. They are designed to promote positive family environments and reduce levels of expressed emotions within families as well as providing insight into the signs and symptoms of mental illness, so family members can anticipate and help stop relapse. There have been various psychosocial programmes designed over the years, including: counselling groups for family members; family therapy; educational groups for relatives; group therapy for family members; and educational lectures for family members. These are delivered by skilled, trained mental health professionals, who work with the families every 
DT two weeks or so, sometimes across considerable time periods, such as one year.
DT Brief family intervention is a form of family intervention where a mental health professional educates the person with schizophrenia and their family members about the illness over a limited number of sessions.
DT This review investigates the effects of brief family intervention for people with schizophrenia, compared to standard or usual care.A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trial register was carried out in July 2012. Four randomised studies, with a total of 163 participants were included. Results were limited, so it is not clear if brief family intervention reduces admission to hospital, decreases people using health services and reduces relapse for people with schizophrenia. The review found some evidence that brief family intervention might increase the understanding of family members about mental illness. However, all main findings are not strong and based on low or very low quality evidence. Despite this, the authors of the review suggest that brief family intervention should not be completely dismissed, as it is in a current state of demand and there are usually resources or local services available for people with mental health problems and their families to participate in as a part of 
DT recovery.The authors also suggest that brief family intervention could be improved to be more effective but this would depend on larger and better studies of brief family intervention being carried out, which would help guide good practice and lead to better outcomes for people with schizophrenia.
